        """Generates forward and reverse operators given a purely-rational
        operator and a function from the operator module.

        Use this like:
        __op__, __rop__ = _operator_fallbacks(just_rational_op, operator.op)

        In general, we want to implement the arithmetic operations so
        that mixed-mode operations either call an implementation whose
        author knew about the types of both arguments, or convert both
        to the nearest built in type and do the operation there. In
        Fraction, that means that we define __add__ and __radd__ as:

            def __add__(self, other):
                # Both types have numerators/denominator attributes,
                # so do the operation directly
                if isinstance(other, (int, Fraction)):
                    return Fraction(self.numerator * other.denominator +
                                    other.numerator * self.denominator,
                                    self.denominator * other.denominator)
                # float and complex don't have those operations, but we
                # know about those types, so special case them.
                elif isinstance(other, float):
                    return float(self) + other
                elif isinstance(other, complex):
                    return complex(self) + other
                # Let the other type take over.
                return NotImplemented

            def __radd__(self, other):
                # radd handles more types than add because there's
                # nothing left to fall back to.
                if isinstance(other, numbers.Rational):
                    return Fraction(self.numerator * other.denominator +
                                    other.numerator * self.denominator,
                                    self.denominator * other.denominator)
                elif isinstance(other, Real):
                    return float(other) + float(self)

        There are 5 different cases for a mixed-type addition on
        Fraction. I'll refer to all of the above code that doesn't
        refer to Fraction, float, or complex as "boilerplate". 'r'
        will be an instance of Fraction, which is a subtype of
        Rational (r : Fraction <: Rational), and b : B <:
        Complex. The first three involve 'r + b':

            1. If B <: Fraction, int, float, or complex, we handle
               that specially, and all is well.
            2. If Fraction falls back to the boilerplate code, and it
               were to return a value from __add__, we'd miss the
               possibility that B defines a more intelligent __radd__,
               so the boilerplate should return NotImplemented from
               __add__. In particular, we don't handle Rational
               here, even though we could get an exact answer, in case
               the other type wants to do something special.
            3. If B <: Fraction, Python tries B.__radd__ before
               Fraction.__add__. This is ok, because it was
               implemented with knowledge of Fraction, so it can
               handle those instances before delegating to Real or
               Complex.

        The next two situations describe 'b + r'. We assume that b
        didn't know about Fraction in its implementation, and that it
        uses similar boilerplate code:

            4. If B <: Rational, then __radd_ converts both to the
               builtin rational type (hey look, that's us) and
               proceeds.
            5. Otherwise, __radd__ tries to find the nearest common
               base ABC, and fall back to its builtin type. Since this
               class doesn't subclass a concrete type, there's no
               implementation to fall back to, so we need to try as
               hard as possible to return an actual value, or the user
               will get a TypeError.
